                    "explanation": "This is a Remembering-level question. To answer it, you need to recall the symbol for sodium from the periodic table. A helpful strategy is to remember that some elements use Latin roots. Sodium\u2019s Latin name is 'Natrium', which is why its symbol is 'Na'. A quick mnemonic: 'Na \u2013 Not Apparent from English!' to help remember it doesn't match the English spelling."

                    "explanation": "This is an Understanding-level question. To answer it, try to explain in your own words what each chamber does. The right side of the heart handles blood returning from the body and sends it to the lungs to pick up oxygen. The left side receives the oxygenated blood and pumps it to the body. Walking through the process helps you understand how the heart keeps the oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood separate to work efficiently."

                    "explanation": "This is an Applying-level question. Start by recognizing that this is a right triangle, so the Pythagorean theorem applies: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2. Use the values: a = 3 and b = 4. Compute 3\u00b2 = 9 and 4\u00b2 = 16, then add them: 9 + 16 = 25. Now take the square root of 25 to find the hypotenuse: \u221a25 = 5. This shows how to use prior knowledge in a new situation."

Meiosis results in four cells with half the DNA, all genetically different, and is used for reproduction. Notice the patterns: mitosis keeps the DNA the same; meiosis increases variation.

Python stands out due to its readable syntax and broad application. For example, 'print(\"Hello\")' in Python is much simpler than in Java or C++. You're making a justified recommendation by comparing choices and applying logical criteria like simplicity and flexibility."

Then combine your knowledge of experimental design: choose a variable (light type), control others (same plant species, water, soil), and decide on a measurable outcome (growth in cm).
