    "question": "Explain the concept of cloud computing and how it differs from traditional on-premises computing infrastructure.",
    "answer": "Cloud computing delivers computing resources (servers, storage, databases, software) over the internet on a pay-as-you-go basis. Unlike traditional on-premises infrastructure where organizations own and maintain physical hardware in their facilities, cloud computing shifts to a service-based model. Key differences include: cloud uses operational expenditure rather than capital investment; offers rapid scalability without hardware purchases; transfers maintenance responsibility to the provider; enables access from anywhere with internet; and typically provides built-in redundancy and disaster recovery options. This model allows businesses to reduce IT overhead while gaining flexibility and often improved reliability."

    "question": "Explain the concept of machine learning and how it differs from traditional programming approaches.",
    "answer": "Machine learning is an approach where algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions, rather than following explicitly programmed rules. Unlike traditional programming where developers write specific instructions for every scenario, machine learning systems improve their performance through experience, automatically identifying patterns and adapting to new information. Traditional programming uses a direct input-rules-output approach, while machine learning creates models that generalize from examples, making it particularly valuable for complex problems where explicit rules are difficult to define."

    "answer": "Virtualization is a technology that creates virtual versions of computing resources (like servers, storage, or networks) on a single physical hardware system. It enables more efficient hardware utilization by allowing multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously on one physical server, increasing utilization rates from 10-15% to 60-80%. This approach reduces costs, saves energy, improves scalability, and enables faster deployment of resources while maintaining isolation between workloads."

Abstract Product class with common attributes (id, name, price, description) and specialized subclasses (Electronics, Clothing, Books) for type-specific properties.\n\n2. User class with authentication and profile management, extended by Customer and Admin subclasses with different permissions.\n\n3. ShoppingCart class that contains CartItem objects (which link to Products and store quantities), with methods for adding/removing items and calculating totals.\n\n4. Order class to track purchases, linking customers to their selected products, payment status, and shipping details.\n\n5. Payment interface implemented by different payment method classes (CreditCardPayment, PayPalPayment) to process transactions polymorphically.\n\nThe system would use composition for User-ShoppingCart relationships, aggregation for ShoppingCart-CartItem relationships, and implement appropriate design patterns like Factory for product creation and Observer for inventory updates."

    "answer": "I would apply database normalization by first analyzing the current schema and identifying redundancies. Then I would implement 1NF to eliminate repeating groups, 2NF to remove partial dependencies, and 3NF to address transitive dependencies. This would involve creating separate tables for students, courses, departments, and instructors with appropriate primary and foreign keys. For many-to-many relationships like student course enrollments, I'd create junction tables. To balance performance, I would strategically denormalize certain frequently accessed data and create indexes on commonly queried fields. This approach would reduce redundancy while maintaining or improving query performance."

Then I'd train models like LSTM networks or gradient boosting algorithms to capture temporal patterns. The system would incorporate real-time data streams, provide short and long-term predictions, and continuously improve through feedback loops.

    "answer": "To migrate an on-premises application to cloud infrastructure, I would first assess the application's architecture, dependencies, and compliance requirements. Then, I'd choose an appropriate migration strategy (lift-and-shift, platform modernization, or refactoring), redesign the architecture for scalability by implementing auto-scaling, decoupling components, and ensuring statelessness where possible. I would implement infrastructure-as-code for consistency, set up CI/CD pipelines, and design for fault tolerance across availability zones. For data migration, I'd develop a strategy for transfer and validation while minimizing disruption. Finally, I'd implement comprehensive monitoring, optimize for performance and cost, and plan a phased cutover with rollback capabilities."

    "question": "Compare and contrast cloud computing architectures (IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS). How do their differences impact application development strategies for organizations?",
    "answer": "IaaS provides raw infrastructure resources, giving developers full control but requiring them to manage everything from OS up. PaaS offers development platforms with managed infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on code rather than maintenance. SaaS delivers complete applications requiring minimal development work. Organizations with unique requirements and technical expertise often choose IaaS for flexibility, while those prioritizing faster time-to-market select PaaS. Companies seeking standardized solutions with minimal IT overhead typically opt for SaaS. These differences fundamentally shape development strategies by determining resource allocation, required technical skills, development speed, and customization capabilities."

    "answer": "Following Moore's Law, mobile processing power has grown exponentially with multi-core processors and specialized chips enabling desktop-like performance. However, battery technology has improved only incrementally, creating an imbalance where devices can do much more but face energy constraints. Form factors show a pattern of maximizing screen space while maintaining portability, with bezels shrinking and new designs like foldables emerging. This creates a three-speed evolution: rapid advancement in processing, moderate improvement in physical design, and slower progress in battery technology."

    "question": "Examine how different network protocols (TCP, UDP, HTTP) handle data transmission differently and analyze how these differences affect application performance in various scenarios.",
    "answer": "TCP ensures reliable, ordered delivery with flow control but has higher overhead, making it ideal for applications requiring data integrity like file transfers and financial transactions. UDP provides faster transmission with no delivery guarantees, better suited for real-time applications like gaming and streaming where speed outweighs occasional packet loss. HTTP, typically running over TCP, uses a request-response model with evolving versions improving performance\u2014HTTP/2 added multiplexing and compression, while HTTP/3 uses QUIC over UDP for better performance in lossy networks. These differences significantly impact application performance: latency-sensitive applications benefit from UDP or HTTP/3, while data-critical applications require TCP's reliability despite its overhead."

While AI automates routine tasks in software development and data analysis, it simultaneously creates new specialized roles like AI engineers and ethics specialists. Historical technological revolutions suggest long-term job creation will likely outpace losses, though with significant transition challenges.
