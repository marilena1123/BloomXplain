    "answer": "Slope in a linear equation represents the rate of change between variables, calculated as rise over run.

When finding the distance between two points in a coordinate plane, we create a right triangle where the horizontal and vertical distances form the legs, and the direct distance forms the hypotenuse. The formula d = \u221a[(x\u2082 - x\u2081)\u00b2 + (y\u2082 - y\u2081)\u00b2] is derived from a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2."

    "answer": "A negative exponent indicates a reciprocal relationship: x^(-n) = 1/(x^n). While positive exponents show repeated multiplication (x^n = x \u00d7 x \u00d7 ... n times), negative exponents tell us to divide by the base raised to that power. When simplifying expressions, the same rules apply to both: add exponents when multiplying terms with the same base, and subtract exponents when dividing them."

If any vertical line intersects the graph more than once, it's not a function because one input value would have multiple outputs."

Different dice combinations represent different climbing routes with varying point values. Players can use probability strategies by calculating expected values of rerolls, understanding the probability distributions of dice combinations, and making risk-reward assessments based on their position compared to opponents.

    "answer": "Geometric Projection Method: Visualize each equation as a plane in 3D space. Start with any point and project it perpendicularly onto the first plane, then project that result onto the second plane, then onto the third plane. Repeat this cycle until the point stops moving significantly. This works because each projection minimizes the distance to a plane while maintaining the constraints of previously considered planes, gradually converging to the intersection point of all three planes. Unlike traditional methods, this approach is iterative and has a clear geometric interpretation, making it more intuitive for spatial thinkers."

Trigonometry would optimize road intersection angles (120\u00b0 where possible to reduce collision points) and calculate proper banking on curves based on design speeds.
