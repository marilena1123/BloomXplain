    "answer": "The internet functions as a vast network of connected computers that share information through standardized protocols. When someone in one country sends a message, it's converted to digital data packets that travel through cables, satellites, and servers before reaching the recipient's device anywhere in the world. This global infrastructure supports various communication tools like email, messaging apps, video calls, and social media, allowing instant communication regardless of physical distance or time zones."

    "question": "Analyze the components of a typical computer system. How do these parts work together to perform different tasks?",
    "answer": "A computer system consists of hardware components (CPU, RAM, storage, motherboard, GPU, power supply, and I/O devices) and software (operating system, applications) working in coordination. The CPU processes instructions while RAM provides temporary storage for active data. Storage devices hold permanent data, and the motherboard connects everything through data buses. When performing tasks, the CPU fetches instructions from RAM, processes them, and sends results to output devices. Input devices allow user interaction, while the operating system manages resources and coordinates operations. This integrated system enables computers to run applications, process information, display media, and communicate with networks."

    "answer": "I propose the \"LinguaBand,\" a wristband-style wearable device that helps students learn new languages. The device resembles a sleek fitness tracker with a small touchscreen display and built-in speakers and microphones. \n\nThe LinguaBand functions by providing micro-learning opportunities throughout the day. It uses haptic feedback to gently remind students when it's time to practice, and the AI-powered system adapts to the student's schedule and learning pace. The device listens to the user's pronunciation attempts and provides immediate feedback through visual cues and subtle vibrations. It pairs with a smartphone app that tracks progress and provides more comprehensive lessons.\n\nThis device specifically solves the problem of inconsistent language practice and pronunciation feedback. Traditional language learning often fails because students don't practice regularly enough and rarely receive immediate feedback on pronunciation. The LinguaBand creates a continuous learning environment where students can practice speaking in short bursts throughout the day and receive instant feedback on their pronunciation, significantly accelerating language acquisition."

The station would feature a canopy of solar panels generating approximately 2kW of power, connected to lithium-ion battery storage for continuous operation. Multiple USB ports and standard outlets would be available under a weather-protected overhang. The station would be located in the central courtyard or quad where it receives maximum sunlight while being accessible between classes. LED lighting powered by the same system would allow nighttime use, and an educational display would show real-time energy production data for science classes."
