    "answer": "Multiplication can be thought of as repeated addition because it's adding the same number multiple times. For example, 5 \u00d7 3 equals 15, which is the same as adding 5 three times: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15."

    "question": "Explain how place value works in our number system. Why does the digit 5 mean different things in the numbers 25, 52, and 500?",
    "answer": "In our base-10 number system, each position represents a power of 10, with the rightmost digit representing ones, the next tens, then hundreds, and so on. The digit 5 means different things because its place value changes: in 25, it's 5 ones (5); in 52, it's 5 tens (50); and in 500, it's 5 hundreds (500)."

    "answer": "Perimeter is the distance around a shape (measured in linear units), while area is the space inside a shape (measured in square units). For a rectangle, if it's 5m long and 3m wide, the perimeter would be 16m (adding all four sides: 5+3+5+3), like measuring the fence needed around a garden. The area would be 15m\u00b2 (5\u00d73), like measuring how much carpet you'd need to cover the floor."

    "question": "Explain why we sometimes need to regroup (or \"borrow\") when subtracting numbers. Use an example like 43 - 25 to show your understanding.",
    "answer": "Regrouping is needed when the digit being subtracted in a place value is larger than the digit we're subtracting from. In 43 - 25, we can't subtract 5 from 3, so we borrow 1 from the tens place (4), making it 3 tens and 13 ones. Then we calculate 13 - 5 = 8 ones, and 3 - 2 = 1 ten, giving us 18."

    "answer": "The patterns include: when using only one coin type, you need 10 five-cent coins, 5 ten-cent coins, or 2 twenty-five-cent coins; when mixing coin types, the number of five-cent coins must be even when combined with ten-cent coins; and combinations with more twenty-five-cent coins generally require fewer total coins to reach 50 cents."

    "answer": "Breaking down 8 \u00d7 12 into 8 \u00d7 10 + 8 \u00d7 2 is more efficient because it requires fewer calculations (just 3 operations vs 11 additions), uses the distributive property strategically, and leverages the simplicity of multiplying by 10."

A rectangle must have four right angles and opposite sides of equal length, while a square must have four right angles and all sides of equal length.

Blanket (medium unit): 1 blanket equals 5 pillows, or about 100 inches, representing the length of a typical blanket.\n\n3.
