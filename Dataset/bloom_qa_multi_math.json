    "answer": "The quadratic formula is x = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b\u00b2 - 4ac))/(2a) for the equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0. Completing the square is used in its derivation because it transforms the quadratic expression into a perfect square trinomial plus a constant, allowing us to isolate the variable by applying the square root property."

    "answer": "A logarithm is the inverse function of exponentiation. If b^x = y, then log_b(y) = x. Logarithm properties mirror exponent properties: the product rule (log_b(xy) = log_b(x) + log_b(y)) corresponds to b^(m+n) = b^m \u00d7 b^n; the quotient rule (log_b(x/y) = log_b(x) - log_b(y)) corresponds to b^(m-n) = b^m \u00f7 b^n; and the power rule (log_b(x^n) = n \u00d7 log_b(x)) corresponds to (b^m)^n = b^(m\u00d7n)."

Substituting the known values: sin(75\u00b0) = sin(45\u00b0)cos(30\u00b0) + cos(45\u00b0)sin(30\u00b0) = (\u221a2/2)(\u221a3/2) + (\u221a2/2)(1/2) = (\u221a6 + \u221a2)/4."

If this growth rate continues, in what year will the town's population reach 100,000?",

    "question": "A construction company needs to build a rectangular storage facility with a perimeter of 100 meters.\n\na) Apply the concept of optimization to find the dimensions (length and width) that would maximize the area of the storage facility. Show your work and explain your approach.\n\nb) Analyze how the area of the rectangle changes as the length increases from 0 to 50 meters. Identify any patterns in this relationship and determine whether the maximum area you found in part (a) is consistent with these patterns.",
    "answer": "a) To maximize the area of a rectangular facility with a 100-meter perimeter, I'll use calculus. With length l and width w, the perimeter equation gives us w = 50 - l. The area function is A = l \u00d7 w = l(50 - l) = 50l - l\u00b2. Taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero: dA/dl = 50 - 2l = 0, which gives l = 25 meters. The second derivative is -2, confirming this is a maximum. Therefore, the optimal dimensions are 25 meters by 25 meters, creating a square with maximum area of 625 square meters.\n\nb) As length increases from 0 to 50 meters, the area follows a parabolic pattern described by A = 50l - l\u00b2. The area starts at 0 when l = 0, increases until reaching its maximum of 625 square meters when l = 25, then decreases back to 0 when l = 50. This pattern confirms our finding in part (a) that the maximum area occurs exactly at l = 25 meters."

While n\u00b2 grows polynomially, 2^n grows exponentially, which eventually outpaces any polynomial growth. This is proven by the limit of n\u00b2/2^n approaching 0 as n approaches infinity."

Student A suggests using the trapezoidal rule with 10 subdivisions, while Student B suggests using Simpson's rule with 6 subdivisions. \n\nEvaluate which method would likely yield more accurate results for finding the area under the curve y = x\u00b2 + 3x + 2 from x = 0 to x = 4. Justify your evaluation with mathematical reasoning.\n\nThen, design your own numerical integration method that might be more efficient than both methods for this particular function. Explain your approach and why you believe it would be effective.",
    "answer": "Simpson's rule (Student B) would yield more accurate results despite having fewer subdivisions. For a quadratic function like y = x\u00b2 + 3x + 2, Simpson's rule actually produces the exact answer with any number of subdivisions because Simpson's rule is exact for polynomials up to degree 3. The trapezoidal rule (Student A) will always have some error for this curve because it approximates the function with straight lines.\n\nFor this particular function, the most efficient method would be direct analytical integration since the antiderivative is straightforward to calculate. By evaluating \u222b(x\u00b2 + 3x + 2)dx from x = 0 to x = 4, we get exactly 160/3 or approximately 53.33, with no numerical approximation error."

    "answer": "A square garden with sides of 25 meters each will maximize the area to 625 square meters. This can be proven by setting up the area function A = x(50-x) where x is length and 50-x is width (since perimeter = 100m). Taking the derivative and setting it to zero (50-2x=0) gives x=25, confirming a square is optimal.\n\nAn alternative design could feature a circular central plaza (radius \u224816m) with radiating triangular plots. While a pure circle would actually provide more area (\u2248796 square meters), the mixed-geometry design offers practical advantages: the central area serves as a gathering space, triangular sections create microclimates for different plants, and the layout provides natural pathways while maintaining visual interest."
