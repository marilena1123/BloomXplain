    "answer": "An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and two equal angles. The equal angles are opposite to the equal sides. It has one axis of symmetry, and if an altitude is drawn from the vertex angle to the base, it also serves as the perpendicular bisector of the base and the angle bisector of the vertex angle."

    "question": "Explain why the interior angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees.",
    "answer": "The interior angles of a triangle always sum to 180 degrees because of the parallel line postulate in Euclidean geometry. When a line parallel to one side of the triangle is drawn through the opposite vertex, the three interior angles correspond to angles that form a straight line (180 degrees)."

    "question": "In your own words, explain what the slope of a line represents in a real-world context.",
    "answer": "The slope of a line represents the rate of change between two variables. In real-world contexts, it shows how quickly one quantity changes in relation to another. For example, on a distance-time graph, the slope represents speed; on a cost-quantity graph, it represents the price per unit; and on a height-distance graph of a hill, it represents the steepness. A positive slope indicates both quantities increase together, while a negative slope shows an inverse relationship."

    "answer": "The Pythagorean theorem states that in right triangles, the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = c\u00b2). It's useful for solving real-world problems involving distances, construction, navigation, and engineering because it allows us to calculate unknown lengths when direct measurement isn't possible, especially in situations involving perpendicular relationships."

    "question": "Explain why a negative number multiplied by another negative number results in a positive number.",
    "answer": "When you multiply two negative numbers, you're essentially taking the opposite of a negative quantity. Mathematically, this can be understood as \"the opposite of losing something,\" which results in a gain (positive). It follows the pattern where each negative sign changes the direction of the result, so two negative signs cancel each other out, yielding a positive product."

Each level provides different amounts of available ingredients and required potion volumes.\n3. Players must determine the exact quantities of each ingredient needed for the current potion size.\n4. As levels progress, more ingredients are added and the proportional relationships become more complex (involving 3-4 ingredients with interdependent ratios).\n\nHow proportions are applied:\nPlayers must set up and solve proportion equations. For example, if the base recipe requires a 3:2:1 ratio of ingredients A:B:C to make 6 units, and they need to make 15 units, they must calculate that they need 7.5 units of A, 5 units of B, and 2.5 units of C. The game teaches direct and inverse proportion through gameplay, as sometimes ingredients have opposing effects that must be balanced."

Lighter objects use \"dustheft\" (1/50 of a heft) and heavier weights use \"stoneheft\" (25 hefts).\nConversion: 1 stoneheft = 25 hefts = 1,250 dusthefts\n\nVolume: The \"bubble\" represents the capacity of a common air pocket in Zenith's porous rocks (about 1 liter in Earth terms). Smaller volumes use \"dropbubble\" (1/20 of a bubble) and larger volumes use \"poolbubble\" (15 bubbles).\nConversion: 1 poolbubble = 15 bubbles = 300 dropbubbles\n\nThe units relate through the planet's water equivalent: 1 bubble of zenithian water equals 1 heft, and a cube with sides of 1 span has a volume of 1 bubble."
