    "question": "Explain how cloud computing works and why it has become important for modern businesses.",
    "answer": "Cloud computing delivers computing services (storage, processing power, software) over the internet instead of local hardware. It works by virtualizing resources across distributed networks of physical servers, allowing users to access only what they need. Businesses have embraced cloud computing because it reduces costs (pay-as-you-go model), offers scalability, enables remote work, provides access to advanced technologies, improves disaster recovery capabilities, and allows companies to focus on their core business rather than managing IT infrastructure."

    "question": "Explain how blockchain technology works and why it's considered secure for digital transactions.",
    "answer": "Blockchain technology works as a distributed digital ledger where data is stored in blocks linked through cryptography. Each transaction is verified by multiple computers (nodes) using consensus mechanisms before being added to the chain. The technology is considered secure because: it's decentralized with no single point of failure; it's immutable since altering one block requires changing all subsequent blocks across the majority of the network; it uses cryptographic hashing to protect data integrity; and it employs public-private key encryption for transaction security."

    "answer": "I would create a spreadsheet with separate sections for income and expenses. For expenses, I'd include columns for item descriptions, estimated costs, actual costs, and variance. Income sources would be listed similarly. I'd use SUM formulas to calculate totals automatically, and create visual elements like pie charts to represent budget allocation. The spreadsheet would include formulas to calculate the remaining budget and highlight over-budget categories using conditional formatting. This allows for real-time budget tracking as plans evolve and expenses occur."

    "answer": "I would implement two-factor authentication for the school's grading system by first requiring the standard username/password login, followed by a second verification method. For teachers and staff, I'd offer a choice between authentication apps (like Google Authenticator) or SMS verification codes sent to registered mobile numbers. For administrative accounts with higher privileges, I'd recommend hardware security keys for maximum protection. The system would need clear instructions, technical support resources, and a secure account recovery process for lost devices. This approach balances security with usability in an educational environment."

These would be strategically placed in diverse locations and connected via IoT technology to a central database. The collected data would be analyzed using statistical methods to identify patterns, trends, and correlations with health outcomes. A public dashboard and mobile app would make findings accessible to residents, while alerts would notify the community about hazardous conditions. I would also engage schools in citizen science projects to expand data collection and increase environmental literacy. The system would be powered by renewable energy and designed to inform policy decisions about environmental improvements."

    "answer": "Cloud storage offers accessibility from anywhere with internet, professional security, scalable costs, and redundant backups, but has privacy concerns and depends on internet connectivity. Local storage provides faster access speeds, complete privacy control, and no internet dependency, but limits accessibility and risks physical damage. The better option depends on data sensitivity, access requirements, file sizes, budget, internet reliability, and technical expertise. Cloud is ideal for collaboration and mobility, while local storage works better for large files, sensitive data, and areas with unreliable internet."

    "answer": "Social media algorithms determine feed content primarily through user engagement history (likes, comments, shares), personal connection strength, content recency, and time spent viewing similar content. Key patterns include prioritizing emotionally provocative content that generates reactions, content from close connections, media formats that increase time-on-platform (especially video), and content similar to what users have previously engaged with. These algorithms create feedback loops that reinforce existing preferences while balancing new content discovery to maximize user retention and platform monetization opportunities."

    "answer": "Social media offers benefits as a news source including immediacy, accessibility, diverse perspectives, and interactive engagement. However, significant drawbacks include widespread misinformation, echo chambers, lack of fact-checking, sensationalism, and limited context for complex issues. Unlike traditional media, social media typically lacks professional journalistic standards and editorial oversight, making it less reliable for comprehensive and accurate news consumption."

    "question": "Critique the claim that artificial intelligence will eventually replace human workers in most industries. What evidence supports or contradicts this assertion?",
    "answer": "The claim that AI will replace most human workers is overly simplistic. Evidence supporting it includes AI's growing capabilities in professional fields, economic pressure for automation, and historical job displacement by technology. However, contradicting evidence is substantial: AI tends to complement rather than replace humans, technological revolutions create new job categories, humans retain advantages in creativity and emotional intelligence, and many jobs require adaptability and social skills AI lacks. Technical limitations and implementation barriers further slow wholesale replacement. A more nuanced prediction is that AI will transform work rather than eliminate human workers, shifting employment toward roles leveraging uniquely human capabilities."

    "question": "Assess whether cloud storage is more secure than local storage for sensitive personal data. Justify your evaluation with specific security considerations.",
    "answer": "Neither cloud nor local storage is inherently more secure; it depends on implementation. Cloud storage offers professional security management, regular updates, strong encryption, and redundancy, but introduces risks from online accessibility and third-party control. Local storage provides physical control and isolation from network attacks but is vulnerable to physical threats, theft, and often lacks robust backup systems. The best approach depends on specific security needs and proper implementation of security measures."

    "answer": "The environmental impact of electronics is severe, with manufacturing and disposal causing pollution, resource depletion, and toxic waste, while devices are typically used for only 2-5 years. Planned obsolescence is generally unethical as it deliberately shortens product lifespans to increase sales, exacerbating environmental damage and exploiting consumers, though companies could instead focus on sustainable design, repairability, and longer-lasting products."

    "question": "Judge the effectiveness of biometric authentication methods (fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.) compared to traditional password systems. Which approach provides better security while maintaining user convenience?",
    "answer": "Biometric methods offer superior convenience through quick, memory-free authentication while providing strong security against common threats like password guessing. However, they have permanent consequences if compromised since biometric data cannot be changed like passwords. Traditional passwords remain more private and accessible but suffer from user-created vulnerabilities. Overall, biometrics provide better security-convenience balance for everyday use, while the most effective approach is multi-factor authentication combining both methods for sensitive applications."
